    "I find Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to be one of the most exciting (yet under-rated) developments in data analysis and thus I want to do my part to spread the knowledge. So what's it all about? Well there are two major flavors of TDA: persistent homology and mapper. Both are useful, and can be used to supplement each other. In this post (and the next couple of posts) we will cover persistent homology. TDA in general is very mathematical (it was born out the \"lab\" of a mathematics group at Stanford, particularly Gunnar Carlsson and his graduate student Gurjeet Singh, although the foundations had been developed for years before by others) and thus we cannot really study it without learning a lot of math. Hence, this post is going to be just as much a tutorial on various topics in higher math as it is TDA, so if you're not that interested in TDA but want to learn about topology, group theory, linear algebra, graph theory and abstract algebra, then this might be useful just in that regard. Of course, I will not cover these math topics in as much detail or with as much rigor as a textbook would, but my hope is if you understand what I present here, reading a textbook (or math papers) will make a whole lot more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is persistent homology and why should I care?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a typical data set being a big Excel file with columns being various parameters and the rows being individual data points. Say there are 100 columns and 900 rows. If we think of the rows as being data points, then we can think of them as being 100-dimensional data points. Obviously, helplessly constrained to our 3-dimensional universe, we have no way of seeing what are data _looks_ like. Well, of course there are numerous methods for projecting high-dimensional data down to a lower dimensional space that we _can_ see. Usually we want to see our data so we can easily identify patterns, particularly clusters. The most well-known of these visualization methods is probably principal component analysis (PCA).  But all of these methods involve transforming our original data in a way that loses some potentially valuable information. There's no free lunch here, if you use PCA to project 100-dimensional data to a 2-dimensional plot, you're going to be missing something.\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistent homology (henceforth just __PH__) gives us a way to find interesting patterns in data without having to \"downgrade\" the data in anyway so we can see it. PH let's us leave our data in it's original, ultra-high dimensional space and tells us how many clusters there are, and how many loop-like structures there are in the data, all without being able to actually see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider a biologist studying some genes in cells. She uses fancy equipment to measure the expression levels of 100 genes in 900 different cells. She's interested in genes that might play a role in cell division. Being the cutting-edge biologist she is, she utilizes persistent homology to analyze her data and PH reports her data has a prominent _cycle_, which she further analyzes and is able to confirm that a subset of her 100 genes seem to have a cyclical expression pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of topology in mathematics studies properties of spaces where all we care about is the relationship of points to one another, unlike geometry, where exact distances and angles are important. Thus PH let's us ask topological questions of our data in a reliable way without having to adulterate the data in anyway. The conventional output from persistent homology is a \"barcode\" graph that looks like this:\n",

    "What is important about topological spaces as opposed to any other mathematical abstraction? Well, one important aspect is that topological spaces end up defining a notion of *closeness* between elements in a set that has a defined topology. In a \"raw\" set that has no structure defined, e.g. $Y = \\{c,d,e\\}$, it's just a collection of abstract objects. That's it, there's nothing more we say about this set or it's elements. But once we define a topology on $Y$, then we can answer questions like \"is the element $c \\in Y$ closer to $d$ than $e$ is to $d$?\"\n",

So far we've been considering __finite__ topological spaces, that is, the set $X$ for which we've defined a topology has a finite number of elements. Of course topological spaces do not have to be finite, and we'll eventually spend most of our time considering infinite topological spaces such as those defined on the set of real numbers. When we start to consider those types of spaces, visualizing them tends to be easier as we can often draw diagrams. As you've probably noticed, all this abstract non-sense about open sets defining a topological space seems really hard to grasp intuitively. As it turns out, however, there is another way to represent *finite* topological spaces, and that is by using __directed graphs__."

When drawing graphs with weighted edges, one way to depict this would be to simply make edges with bigger weights as proportionally thicker lines. Mathematically, a graph with vertices, edges, and weights is defined as a graph $G(V,E,w)$ where $w : E \\rightarrow \\mathbb R$ ($w$ is a function that maps each edge in E to a real number, it's weight). Similarly, one can have a function that endows each vertex with a weight. One might depict this where nodes (vertices) are of different sizes reflecting their respective weights. "

Another familiar one is the 2-dimensional Euclidian space in $\\mathbb R^2$, where the distance function between any two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is defined as $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.\n",

Excellent question, and the answer is simple: you just play around with various levels for $\\epsilon$ and see what seems to result in a meaningful VR complex. If you set $\\epsilon$ too  small, then your complex may just consist of the original point cloud, or only a few edges between points. If you set $\\epsilon$ too big, then the point cloud will just become one massive ultradimensional simplex. As we will learn later, the key to actually discovering meaningful patterns in a simplicial complex is to continuously vary the $\\epsilon$ parameter (and continually re-build complexes) from 0 to a maximum that results in a single massive simplex. Then you generate a diagram that shows what topological features are born and die as $\\epsilon$ continuously increases. We assume that features that persist for long intervals over $\\epsilon$ are meaningful features whereas features that are very short-lived are likely noise. This procedure is called __persistent homology__ as it finds the  homological features of a topological space (specifically a simplicial complex) that persist while you vary $\\epsilon$.
