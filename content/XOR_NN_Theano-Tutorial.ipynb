    "Theano is part framework and part library for evaluating and optimizing mathematical expressions. It's popular in the machine learning world because it allows you to build up optimized symbolic computational graphs and the gradients can be automatically computed. Moreover, Theano also supports running code on the GPU. Automatic gradients + GPU sounds pretty nice. I won't be showing you how to run on the GPU because I'm using a Macbook Air and as far as I know, Theano doesn't support or barely supports OpenCL at this time. But you can check out their <a href=\"http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/using_gpu.html\">documentation</a> if you have an nVidia GPU ready to go."

The reason I wrote this post is because I found the existing Theano tutorials to be not simple enough. I'm all about reducing things to fundamentals. Given that, I will not be using all the bells-and-whistles that Theano has to offer and I'm going to be writing code that maximizes for readability. Nonetheless, using what I show here, you should be able to scale up to more complex algorithms."
