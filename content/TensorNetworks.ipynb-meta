Summary: Tensor Networks can be seen as a higher-order generalization of traditional deep neural networks, and yet they lack an explicit non-linearity such as applying the ReLU or sigmoid function as we do with neural nets. A deeper understanding of what nonlinearity actually means, however, reveals that tensor networks can indeed learn non-linear functions. The non-linearity of tensor networks arises soley from the architecture and topology of the network itself.
