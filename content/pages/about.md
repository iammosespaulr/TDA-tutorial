The blog began as a single-contributor personal blog but I'm planning to transition it into a multi-contributor blog.

The current blog contributors are as follows:

Hi, my name is Brandon. I'm a former web programmer (primarily), but now a 4th year medical student.
During my first year of medical school I started reading about and implementing machine learning algorithms
and decided I wanted to make machine learning a part of my career. My posts here are my own attempts at teaching
what I'm learning. I tend to be more academic/theory-oriented rather than working on practical, scale applications.
