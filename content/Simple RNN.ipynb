    "You may have noticed I already have an article about building a simple recurrent network (in Python). Why am I making another one? Well, in that article, I show how to build an RNN that solves a temporal XOR problem and then how to do sequence prediction of characters. I think that article betrayed my mission of making things as simple as possible. Additionally, I ended up using a scipy optimizer to find the weights instead of implementing my own gradient descent. This article is meant as a prequel to that one. Here we're going to build an RNN that solves a temporal/sequential version of the problem in the aforementioned `i am trask` article where $y=1$ if and only if $x_1$ in a $(x_1, x_2)$ tuple is $1$. This problem is actually a lot easier for a neural network to learn than XOR because it doesn't require any hidden units in an ordinary feedforward architecture (we <em>will</em> use hidden units in our RNN implementation). Since this problem is easier, I can demonstrate how we can train the network using ordinary backpropagation like `i am trask` does in his article. No need for optimization libraries.\n",

    "My previous posts all use Python and Python is surely a darling of the data science/machine learning world. I can unequivocally say that Python is my hands-down favorite programming language. Python's main strengths are its clean and simple syntax and of course the massive community and number of libraries available. Unfortunately, Python's strength of clean syntax completely disappears when you have to use numpy for linear algebra. Take this line for example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "np.multiply(vec1, np.multiply(vec2, (1 - vec2)))\n",

This is where it becomes clear why (unfortunately) so many people in industry and academia prefer proprietary tools like Matlab. This is what the above line looks like in Julia and what it should look like in any language purporting to be for scientific computing.\n",

If Julia becomes popular, I think it would be extremely well-suited for data science and machine learning applications. I strongly recommend at least trying out Julia. Even though it's not a mature language yet, if you're mostly doing data science/machine learning fundamentals like me, it will serve this purpose very well. If you need a production-ready language, then stick with Python, R or Matlab.\n",
    "\n",

The following code is almost exactly the same as Matlab/Octave syntax and if you don't have Matlab experience, then it should still be very obvious what's going on, and I of course will do my best to explain. If there's interest, I may supply a downloadable IPython notebook version of this."

    "The strength of RNNs is that they have \"memory.\" They can retain information about previous inputs through time. The degree and duration of this memory depends on the implementation. Our implementation here is very simple and has a relatively short memory. This memory allows RNNs to process information differently than a feedforward network, they can process information as a stream of information through time. This makes them very useful for time series predictions and for problems where the input and outputs may need to be variable length vectors.\n",

We could design our RNN to accept an $X_1, X_2$ tuple like the feedforward version, but then it wouldn't really need a memory at all. So in order to demonstrate it's memory capability, we will only feed one input at a time.

In our actual code, we of course can't use a `?` but I will simply make it a 0 (arbitrarily).\n",

Thus, for each time step, we feed the output of the hidden layer from the last time step back into the hidden layer of the current time step. This is how we achieve the memory. It turns out implementing this is actually really simple, and we can do so by re-imagining our network as a feedforward network with some additional input units called <em>contex units</em>. These context units are treated exactly like ordinary input units, with weighted connections to the hidden layer and no activation function. Unlike a normal input unit, however, we aren't supplying the data, the context units simply return the output of $t-1$'s hidden layer.

Of course the value 0.843 will be sent over to the hidden layer after it's been weighted.\n",

    "<b>It worked!</b> As you can see our neural network output exactly what we expected. Keep in mind we ignore the first bit in the output vector. Although in this case the network happened to output 0 as the first bit like we defined in our $Y$ vector, it could have also output 1 and it would still be correct since the rest of the output sequence is indeed the computed `LEFTBIT` of each sequential pair of bits in our input vector.\n",

    "Hopefully this was easy to follow. This was really a bare-bones implementation of a simple recurrent neural network (other than the fact we added in the momentum method to help it learn better). To take this further, I suggest you try defining a cost function (e.g. the cross-entropy cost function) and graph the cost versus the epochs. Then you can vary the hyperparameters of the network (e.g. $\\alpha, \\epsilon, $ the number of hidden units, etc) and see how it effects the gradient descent. \n",
